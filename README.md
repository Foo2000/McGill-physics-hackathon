# McGill-physics-hackathon
This project, "Noah's Ark" was made in 25 hours for the 2019 McGill Hackathon.

It resulted in an application displaying interactively the number of cities flooded as the world's sea water level increases.
Link for the application: https://walk-on-water.herokuapp.com/ .

The presentation's Power Point is "Noah's Ark.pptx".

The simulation Jupyter file is "HeightMap.ipynb".
